# Final-assignment-for-Problem-driven-algorithm-design-course
A simple project compiled with Qt(open source version for personal users) based on Dev-C++.
It was developed in cooperation with my classmate and old friend bearboy233(github: bearboy233-z).

Put the files in an English path or you may not be able to start the game correctly.
